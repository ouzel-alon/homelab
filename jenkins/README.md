# Jenkins

Spins up a single-replica pod of a Jenkins controller backed by a persistent volume.

The Jenkins UI is exposed over the `/jenkins` URL path via an ingress rule.

## Requirements

* Kubernetes 1.26+ (including minikube)
* An ingress controller installed on the cluster. If you're using minikube, enable the `ingress` addon.

## How to use

In `volume.yaml`, update the node where the persistent volume will be bound to. This defaults to the second minikube node in a multinode cluster setup.

```yaml
nodeSelectorTerms:
- matchExpressions:
  - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
      operator: In
      values:
      - minikube-m02
```

Deploy to your cluster:

```bash
cd jenkins
kubectl apply -k .
```

Then check if it's running and the ingress rule has your cluster IP:

```bash
$ kubectl rollout status deployment/jenkins -n jenkins
deployment "jenkins" successfully rolled out

$ kubectl get ingress -n jenkins
NAME              CLASS   HOSTS   ADDRESS           PORTS   AGE
jenkins-ingress   nginx   *       <your-cluster-ip> 80      x

$ curl -i "http://$(minikube ip)/jenkins"
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: x
Content-Length: 0
Connection: keep-alive
Location: http://<your-cluster-ip>/jenkins/
```

## Initial setup

Grab the initial password from the pod, replacing the command below with the jenkins pod name:

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n jenkins <REPLACEME> -- cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Then navigate with your browser to the `/jenkins` URL on your external cluster IP and provide it the initial password to begin the first time setup process.

## Notes

The manifests use the `jenkins` namespace. Update it if you want Jenkins to run somewhere else.

If using the `jenkins/inbound-agent` image, ensure that the container template name in the plugin is set to `jnlp`
